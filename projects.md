Computational Social Science Project 1: Reproducibility and GitHub

In this project, I demonstrated an understanding of the fundamentals of creating a reproducible data
science workflow. I practiced creating, cloning, pulling and pushing respositories,  used GitHub to collaborate with others on 
code, and created a personal website using Github pages.
