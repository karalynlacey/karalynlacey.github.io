## Computational Social Science Project 1: Reproducibility and GitHub

In this project, I demonstrate an understanding of the fundamentals of creating a reproducible data
science workflow. I practice creating, cloning, pulling and pushing respositories, use GitHub to collaborate with others on 
code, and created a personal website using Github pages.
