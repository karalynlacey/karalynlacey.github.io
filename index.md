## Karalyn's Research

In her reserach as a PhD student, Karalyn is interested in the 
intersection between public safety systems, actors, and 
society. She produces evidence on what those who are most impacted by both 
crime and the current public safety infrastructure want and need, and what 
strategies and programs can be implemented to build a bridge from our current legal 
and social policies to ones that effectively and authentically meet those 
wants and needs.
